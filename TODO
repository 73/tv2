Copy over command-line options and other niceties and details from `note`.

Sort notes most recently modified at top

Choose a better palette and other basic appearance improvements

Smarter search box:
Auto-complete a note's title and select it if it starts with search terms
Selecting a note should place its title in the search box
Use the search box contents to decide what to open on <Enter>, if a note
is autocompleted open it if not open a new note
ctrl-d deselects a selected note
Tab consumes the autocomplete ghost text

'You have no notes yet' or 'Enter to create new note' in empty list

More efficient search algorithm.

ctrl-r to rename notes in list

ctrl-j, ctrl-k to move up and down in list
Something seems to be interfering here.

shift-ctrl-v (or something else) to paste clipboard as new note.
But how do you choose the note title and body?

ctrl-del to delete note

Note body previews

If no note is selected and the user hits down, first note should be
selected (not second)

Add an informative footer. My idea is to have it say what version of Terminal
Velocity you're running, where your notes dir is, and how many notes you have,
but also to use it to show warnings and error messages (or debug messages in
debug mode), messages about git integration, etc.
