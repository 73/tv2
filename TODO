Copy over command-line options and other niceties and details from `note`.

Sort notes most recently modified at top

Choose a better palette and other basic appearance improvements

Autocomplete:
x Esc or ctrl-d should clear selected note and autocomplete text
x Tab should consume autocomplete text
- Tab again to move from one matching note to the next
- Handle up and down arrows and pgup and pgdn, manually selecting a note in
  the list box should put its title in the search box also

'You have no notes yet' or 'Enter to create new note' in empty list

More efficient search algorithm.

ctrl-r to rename notes in list

ctrl-j, ctrl-k to move up and down in list
Something seems to be interfering here.

shift-ctrl-v (or something else) to paste clipboard as new note.
But how do you choose the note title and body?

ctrl-del to delete note

Note body previews

If no note is selected and the user hits down, first note should be
selected (not second) (this is also a problem with pgdn)

Add an informative footer. My idea is to have it say what version of Terminal
Velocity you're running, where your notes dir is, and how many notes you have,
but also to use it to show warnings and error messages (or debug messages in
debug mode), messages about git integration, etc.

Add updated column to note list

Make title and updated columns clickable, to change sort order
