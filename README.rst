Terminal Velocity
=================


`Terminal Velocity` is a fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal, that
focuses on letting you create or find a note as quickly and easily as possible,
then uses your ``$EDITOR`` to open and edit the note. It is heavily inspired
by the OS X app `Notational Velocity <http://notational.net/>`_.
For screenshots and features, see the
`Terminal Velocity website <http://seanh.github.com/terminal_velocity>`_.

To quit the app, press ``ctrl-c`` or ``ctrl-x``.
