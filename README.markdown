Terminal Velocity
=================

A Notational Velocity clone for the unix terminal, that uses your `$EDITOR` for
note editing.

It's not 0.1 yet but it works, just needs lots of polish.

Requires Python 2.7 and urwid (pip install urwid).

Some code snippets ideas borrowed from
[Andrew Wagner](https://github.com/drewm1980/nv-console) and
[Simon Greenhill](https://bitbucket.org/simongreenhill/n).
